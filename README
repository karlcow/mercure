# Planet

Planet is a flexible feed aggregator. It downloads news feeds published by
web sites and aggregates their content together into a single combined feed,
latest news first.  This version of Planet is named Mercure as we burnt a
lot of the original code.

It uses Sam Ruby's Planet Venus code. It is for now just an exercise to see
if it can be improved with more modern packages and tools.

## TODO
